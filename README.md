## FaceMaskDetector
In this project we aim to build a model that detects face masks and sunglasses from live feed.

We used 2 different dataset for the project.
* Face Mask Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset/
* Sunglasses Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amol07/sunglasses-no-sunglasses 

### Mask Detection Model Deployment:

* Deploy the project on yout computer.
* You need to read the dataset from the links above.
* Install required packages(Numpy, pandas, opencv, tensorflow keras)
* Open Terminal:
  * To create a model write 'python modelCreatorMask.py' on the terminal
  * To open detector(live feed) write 'python mask_detector.py' on the terminal
* You can try different masks. Wear, unwear masks to see the models prediction on the live camera feed.

### Sunglasses Detection Model Deployment:

* Deploy the project on yout computer.
* You need to read the dataset from the links above.
* Install required packages(Numpy, pandas, opencv, tensorflow keras)
* Open Terminal:
  * To create a model write 'python modelCreatorGlasses.py' on the terminal
  * to open detector(live feed) write 'python glasses_detector.py' on the terminal
* You can try different masks. Wear, unwear masks to see the models prediction on the live camera feed.
